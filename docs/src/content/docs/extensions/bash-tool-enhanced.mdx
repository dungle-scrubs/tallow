description: Enhanced bash with live streaming output and smart truncation.
---

Every command the agent runs streams its output in real time, but
capped to the last 7 lines. Long builds, test suites, and installs
stay readable instead of flooding your screen. A truncation indicator
shows how many lines are hidden.

After execution, the output collapses to a single summary line
(exit code, line count, size). Press `ctrl+o` to expand the full
output at any time.

When command output already contains ANSI colors (for example,
`git diff --color`), bash-live preserves those lines instead of
re-wrapping them, preventing style-reset leakage across rows.

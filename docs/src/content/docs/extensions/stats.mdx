description: Per-session and aggregate usage statistics with /stats command.
---

The **stats** extension records session metadata on shutdown and
provides a `/stats` command for viewing usage statistics across
sessions.

## Usage

```
/stats              # current session
/stats today        # today's aggregate
/stats week         # last 7 days
/stats month        # last 30 days
/stats all          # all time
/stats range 2026-01-01 to 2026-01-31
```

### Flags

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--tools` | Show detailed tool usage breakdown |
| `--json` | Output raw JSON |
| `--model <name>` | Filter by model name (substring match) |

## What it tracks

Each session records:

- Token counts (input, output, cache read, cache write)
- Cost in USD
- Duration (first message to last message)
- Tool invocation counts
- Model used
- Message count

## Aggregate views

Time-range views show:

- Total and average tokens/cost across sessions
- Per-model breakdown
- Tool usage bar charts
- Usage streaks (consecutive days with sessions)

## Data storage

Stats are stored in `~/.tallow/stats.jsonl` as append-only
JSON lines. Each line is one session summary, written on
session shutdown. Sessions with fewer than 2 messages are
skipped.

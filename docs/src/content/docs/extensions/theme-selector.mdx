Switch between 34 built-in **dark-only** themes via the `/theme`
command. As you navigate the list, the entire TUI updates in real
time — colors shift before you commit.

Includes Apprentice, Ayu Mirage, Bluloco Dark, Catppuccin (Frappe,
Macchiato, Mocha), Dracula, Everforest Dark, Flexoki Dark, GitHub
Dark, Gruvbox Dark, Horizon, Iceberg, Kanagawa Wave, Material
Ocean, Mellow, Modus Vivendi, Monokai Pro, Moonlight, Night Owl,
Nord, One Dark, Oxocarbon Dark, Palenight, Poimandres, Rosé Pine,
Solarized Dark, Spaceduck, Synthwave 84, Tokyo Night, Trash Panda,
Vesper, Vitesse Dark, and Zenburn Dark.

Every color token — accent, borders, backgrounds, tool status
indicators, thinking text, message backgrounds — is theme-driven.
Create your own theme as a single JSON file.

For rendering stability, `/theme` now applies colors through pi's
UI API only (no direct OSC terminal background writes), preventing
screen corruption during overlay preview.

## switch\_theme tool

The agent also has a `switch_theme` tool it can call directly.
Instead of opening the picker, you describe what you want in
natural language and the agent picks a matching theme:

- *"give me a warm retro theme"*
- *"something cool and minimal"*
- *"switch to a neon theme"*
- *"random theme"*

The tool filters the 34 themes by mood tags — `cool`, `warm`,
`earthy`, `neon`, `pastel`, `retro`, `vibrant`, `muted`,
`minimal`, `high-contrast`, `low-contrast` — and applies a
matching one. You can also request a specific theme by name
(`"switch to dracula"`) or ask for a random pick with optional
tag filters.

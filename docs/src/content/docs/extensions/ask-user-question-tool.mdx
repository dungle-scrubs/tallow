When the agent needs your input, it presents a proper TUI prompt
not a text dump asking you to type a number. Options are
navigable with arrow keys, with optional descriptions below each
label. A "Type something..." option opens an inline editor for
freeform answers.

Escape in the editor returns to options. Escape from options
cancels the question entirely.

The "Working..." loader is automatically hidden while the prompt
is active and restored after the user answers or cancels.

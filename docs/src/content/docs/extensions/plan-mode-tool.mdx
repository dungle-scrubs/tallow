title: plan-mode-tool
description: Read-only exploration mode for safe code analysis and planning.
---

Toggle with `/plan` or `ctrl+alt+p` to enter a restricted mode
where only read-only tools are available. The agent can explore
the codebase, analyze architecture, and formulate a plan, but
cannot modify any files or run destructive commands.

Plan mode extracts numbered steps from "Plan:" sections in the
agent's response. During execution (after exiting plan mode),
a progress tracking widget shows which steps are complete.
`[DONE:n]` markers in the conversation advance the progress.

## Commands

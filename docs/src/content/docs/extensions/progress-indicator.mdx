description: Terminal progress bar via OSC 9;4 during agent turns.
---

Shows a progress indicator in the terminal's title bar or tab
during agent turns using
[OSC 9;4](https://conemu.github.io/en/AnsiEscapeCodes.html#ConEmu_specific_OSC)
escape sequences.

## How it works

When an agent turn starts, the extension emits an **indeterminate**
progress sequence (`state=3`). When the turn ends, it clears the
progress. Safety-net clears also fire on `agent_end` and
`session_shutdown` to ensure the indicator never gets stuck.

Since the total number of tool calls per turn isn't known ahead of
time, indeterminate mode (pulsing/spinning) is used rather than a
percentage bar.

## Terminal support

| Terminal | Display |
|----------|---------|
| Windows Terminal | Tab progress indicator |
| iTerm2 | Title bar progress |
| WezTerm | Tab progress indicator |
| ConEmu | Taskbar progress |

Unsupported terminals silently ignore the sequences — no errors or
visual artifacts.

## Technical details

Progress is only emitted when `process.stdout.isTTY` is true,
avoiding noise in piped or non-interactive contexts.

The underlying `Terminal` interface also exposes `setProgress(percent)`
and `clearProgress()` methods for extensions that need determinate
(percentage-based) progress bars with built-in throttling (max 1
update per 100ms).

---

The **context-usage** extension adds a `/context` command that
visualizes how your context window is being used with a waffle
chart and per-category token breakdown.

## Usage

```
/context
```

## Categories shown

| Category | What it measures |
|----------|-----------------|
| System prompt | Base instructions |
| System tools | Tool definitions |
| Context files | AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md |
| Skills | Available skill metadata in prompt |
| Messages | Conversation history |
| Free space | Remaining capacity |
| Autocompact buffer | Reserved for compaction (when enabled) |

The waffle chart gives an at-a-glance view of how much context
budget each category consumes, helping you identify when the
conversation is getting large or when context files are taking
too much space.

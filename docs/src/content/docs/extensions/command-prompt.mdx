Scans `prompts/` and `commands/` subdirectories and registers them as
`/dir:name` commands. A file at `prompts/command/new.md` becomes
`/command:new`. Files starting with `_` are skipped (templates/internal files).

## Prompt expansion visibility

When you run a nested prompt command (for example `/plan`), the extension now
separates what is sent to the model from what is shown in chat:

- **Compact mode (default):** chat shows a short summary + preview line
- **Verbose mode:** chat shows the full expanded prompt body

The model still receives the full expanded prompt content in both modes.

### Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `/prompt` | Toggle compact/verbose |
| `/prompt compact` | Switch to compact |
| `/prompt verbose` | Switch to verbose |
| `/prompt status` | Show current mode |
| <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+O</kbd> | Toggle shortcut |

Frontmatter in prompt markdown still controls description and argument hints,
and `$ARGUMENTS`, `$@`, `$1`, `$2`, and `${@:N}` substitutions continue to work.

title: skill-commands
description: Register skills as slash commands without the colon syntax.
---

Registers skills as `/skill-name` commands, an alternative to
tallow's built-in `/skill:name` syntax. Skills with `user-invocable: false` in their
frontmatter are hidden from the command menu.

Enable by setting `enableSkillCommands: false` in `settings.json`
to disable the built-in syntax, then this extension provides the
replacement.

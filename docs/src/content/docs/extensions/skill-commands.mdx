title: skill-commands
description: Register skills as slash commands without the colon syntax.
---

Registers skills as `/skill-name` commands, an alternative to
tallow's built-in `/skill:name` syntax. Skills with `user-invocable: false` in their
frontmatter are hidden from the command menu.

Enable by setting `enableSkillCommands: false` in `settings.json`
to disable the built-in syntax, then this extension provides the
replacement.

## `.claude/` skill bridging

In addition to standard `.tallow/skills/` paths, this extension
scans `.claude/skills/` directories for Claude Code compatibility:

- **~/.claude/skills/** — user-level
- **.claude/skills/** — project-level (relative to cwd)

Skills found in `.claude/skills/` are registered as commands
identically to `.tallow/skills/` skills. On name collision,
`.tallow/` wins.

See [claude-bridge](/extensions/claude-bridge/) for the full
bridging architecture.

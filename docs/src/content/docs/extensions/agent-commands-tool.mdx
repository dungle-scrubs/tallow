description: Register agents as slash commands for direct invocation.

import Gallery from '../../../components/Gallery.astro';

Registers every agent defined in `~/.tallow/agents/` or
`.tallow/agents/` as a `/agent-name` slash command. Typing
`/planner implement user authentication` directly spawns the
planner agent as a subprocess with that task.

No tool call overhead, the agent runs immediately as a child
process with full access to its configured tools and context.

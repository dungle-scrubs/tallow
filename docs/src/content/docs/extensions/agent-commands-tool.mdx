description: Register agents as slash commands for direct invocation.

import Gallery from '../../../components/Gallery.astro';

Registers every agent as a `/agent-name` slash command. Typing
`/planner implement user authentication` directly spawns the
planner agent as a subprocess with that task.

No tool call overhead, the agent runs immediately as a child
process with full access to its configured tools and context.

## Agent directories

Agents are loaded from multiple locations with last-wins priority:

1. **Bundled agents** — shipped with tallow
2. **Package agents** — from settings.json packages
3. **~/.claude/agents/** — user-level, Claude Code compatibility
4. **~/.tallow/agents/** — user-level
5. **Project .claude/agents/** — project-level Claude Code
6. **Project .tallow/agents/** — project-level (highest priority)

`.tallow/` takes precedence over `.claude/` at each scope level.
See [claude-bridge](/extensions/claude-bridge/) for details.

## Frontmatter fields

Agents support the same frontmatter fields as
[subagent-tool](/extensions/subagent-tool/#agent-frontmatter-fields):

- **`disallowedTools`** — tool denylist, filters against the
  built-in set (`read, bash, edit, write, grep, find, ls`)
- **`maxTurns`** — turn budget hint injected into the system
  prompt. **Soft enforcement only** — unlike subagent-tool, this
  extension does not kill the process at the limit because it
  doesn't use `--mode json` for event-based turn counting.
- **`mcpServers`** — restrict MCP server access via
  `PI_MCP_SERVERS` env var

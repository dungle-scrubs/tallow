description: Switchable agent personality modes via markdown files.
---

Drop markdown files with frontmatter into `~/.tallow/output-styles/`
(global) or `.tallow/output-styles/` (project) to define how the agent
communicates. Select with `/output-style` or `/output-style <name>`.

Styles can be appended or prepended to the system prompt. Optional
reminders re-inject the style every N turns to prevent drift in
long conversations.

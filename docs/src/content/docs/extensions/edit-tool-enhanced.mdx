import Gallery from '../../../components/Gallery.astro';

Every file edit the agent makes renders as a full colored diff,
insertions in green, deletions in red, context lines for
orientation. You see exactly what changed before and after,
not just "edit applied."

The diff stays visible after execution and persists with a
summary line showing the file path and confirmation.

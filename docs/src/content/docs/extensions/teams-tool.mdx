import Gallery from '../../../components/Gallery.astro';

Spawn persistent teammate sessions that share an in-memory task
board and can message each other directly — no hub-and-spoke
bottleneck through the orchestrator.

## Tools

**Orchestrator tools** (available to you):
- `team_create` — create a named team
- `team_add_tasks` — add tasks with optional `blockedBy` dependencies
- `team_spawn` — spawn a teammate with a role, model, and tool set
- `team_send` — send a message (fire-and-forget or `wait` for response)
- `team_status` — view task board, teammate states, recent messages
- `team_shutdown` — abort all teammates and archive the team
- `team_resume` — restore an archived team (omit name to list archives)

**Teammate tools** (injected into each spawned agent):
- `team_tasks` — list, claim, complete, or fail tasks
- `team_message` — send messages to other teammates
- `team_inbox` — check for unread messages

## Auto-dispatch

When a teammate completes a task, the extension automatically
checks for newly unblocked tasks and idle teammates. If a match
exists, the idle teammate is woken and assigned the task
immediately — no orchestrator polling needed.

This means dependency chains like `A → B → C` resolve
automatically. Teammates claim parallel work, complete it, and
the blocked downstream task dispatches to whoever goes idle
first.

## Archive and Resume

Shutting down a team — whether via `team_shutdown`, pressing
Escape, or session end — **archives** the team instead of
deleting it. The task board, results, and messages are
preserved.

Call `team_resume` to restore an archived team. The restored
team has no teammates (their sessions are gone), so spawn
fresh ones to pick up where you left off. Any tasks that were
claimed when the team was archived are reset to pending.

Call `team_resume` with no arguments to list all available
archives with task summaries.

## Interrupting with Escape

Pressing Escape kills all team agents (both working and idle)
and archives the team. Task state is preserved — use
`team_resume` to restore and continue work. This mirrors
[subagent](/extensions/subagent-tool/) interrupt behavior.

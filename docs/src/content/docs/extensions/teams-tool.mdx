import Gallery from '../../../components/Gallery.astro';

Spawn persistent teammate sessions that share an in-memory task
board and can message each other directly — no hub-and-spoke
bottleneck through the orchestrator.

## Dashboard workspace

The teams dashboard gives you a live workspace for active teams:
a left tree for team/member navigation plus teammate status cards
with current task, model, last tool, live token meters (↑ input,
↓ output), and a rolling 5-line output preview. Updates stream as team state
changes, and teammates keep running while the dashboard is open.

Dashboard rendering follows shared [presentation roles](/extensions/tool-display/#presentation-roles):
identity/action context is emphasized, while output/feed chatter is
shown with lower visual weight.

### Toggle

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `/team-dashboard` | Toggle dashboard on/off |
| `/team-dashboard on` | Enable dashboard |
| `/team-dashboard off` | Disable dashboard |
| `/team-dashboard status` | Show dashboard status |
| <kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd> | Toggle dashboard on/off |

### Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| <kbd>↑</kbd> / <kbd>↓</kbd> or <kbd>j</kbd> / <kbd>k</kbd> | Move selection in the left tree |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> / <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> | Cycle teams |
| <kbd>PgUp</kbd> / <kbd>PgDn</kbd> | Scroll teammate cards by page |
| <kbd>Ctrl+U</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd> | Scroll teammate cards by half page |
| Mouse wheel / trackpad scroll | Scroll teammate cards |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Close dashboard and return to chat |

> **V1 note:** The dashboard is currently in-process only.
> It reflects the current tallow runtime and does not preserve
> UI focus/selection state across restarts.

## Tools

**Orchestrator tools** (available to you):
- `team_create` — create a named team
- `team_add_tasks` — add tasks with optional `blockedBy` dependencies
- `team_spawn` — spawn a teammate with a role, model, and tool set
- `team_send` — send a message (fire-and-forget or `wait` for response)
- `team_status` — view task board, teammate states, recent messages
- `team_shutdown` — abort all teammates and archive the team
- `team_resume` — restore an archived team (omit name to list archives)

**Teammate tools** (injected into each spawned agent):
- `team_tasks` — list, claim, complete, or fail tasks
- `team_message` — send messages to other teammates
- `team_inbox` — check for unread messages

## Auto-dispatch

When a teammate completes a task, the extension automatically
checks for newly unblocked tasks and idle teammates. If a match
exists, the idle teammate is woken and assigned the task
immediately — no orchestrator polling needed.

This means dependency chains like `A → B → C` resolve
automatically. Teammates claim parallel work, complete it, and
the blocked downstream task dispatches to whoever goes idle
first.

## Archive and Resume

Shutting down a team — whether via `team_shutdown`, pressing
Escape, or session end — **archives** the team instead of
deleting it. The task board, results, and messages are
preserved.

Call `team_resume` to restore an archived team. The restored
team has no teammates (their sessions are gone), so spawn
fresh ones to pick up where you left off. Any tasks that were
claimed when the team was archived are reset to pending.

Call `team_resume` with no arguments to list all available
archives with task summaries.

## Interrupting with Escape

Pressing Escape kills all team agents (both working and idle)
and archives the team. Task state is preserved — use
`team_resume` to restore and continue work. This mirrors
[subagent](/extensions/subagent-tool/) interrupt behavior.

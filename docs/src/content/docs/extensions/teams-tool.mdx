import Gallery from '../../../components/Gallery.astro';

Spawn persistent teammate sessions that share an in-memory task
board and can message each other directly — no hub-and-spoke
bottleneck through the orchestrator.

## Tools

**Orchestrator tools** (available to you):
- `team_create` — create a named team
- `team_add_tasks` — add tasks with optional `blockedBy` dependencies
- `team_spawn` — spawn a teammate with a role, model, and tool set
- `team_send` — send a message (fire-and-forget or `wait` for response)
- `team_status` — view task board, teammate states, recent messages
- `team_shutdown` — abort all teammates and clean up

**Teammate tools** (injected into each spawned agent):
- `team_tasks` — list, claim, complete, or fail tasks
- `team_message` — send messages to other teammates
- `team_inbox` — check for unread messages

## Auto-dispatch

When a teammate completes a task, the extension automatically
checks for newly unblocked tasks and idle teammates. If a match
exists, the idle teammate is woken and assigned the task
immediately — no orchestrator polling needed.

This means dependency chains like `A → B → C` resolve
automatically. Teammates claim parallel work, complete it, and
the blocked downstream task dispatches to whoever goes idle
first.

## Interrupting with Escape

Pressing Escape kills all team agents (both working and idle).
Teams are cognitive work tied to the conversation. The
`agent_end` event aborts streaming sessions and disposes them.
This mirrors [subagent](/extensions/subagent-tool/) interrupt
behavior.

description: Analyze a codebase and generate an AGENTS.md context file.
---

Analyzes your codebase and generates an `AGENTS.md` file capturing
build commands, architecture, project structure, and development
workflow. Future sessions (and other agents) receive this context
automatically.

If an `AGENTS.md` already exists, suggests improvements rather
than overwriting. If only a `CLAUDE.md` exists, migrates it to
`AGENTS.md`. Skips obvious advice, no "write unit tests"
or "use meaningful variable names."

description: Expose slash commands as tools the model can invoke programmatically.
---

Lets the model invoke a curated set of slash commands via the
`run_slash_command` tool. Instead of the user manually running
`/show-system-prompt` or `/compact`, the model can call these
commands itself when it determines they're needed.

## Available commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `show-system-prompt` | Returns the full system prompt text |
| `context` | Returns context window token usage breakdown |
| `compact` | Triggers session compaction to free context space |

## Usage

The model calls the tool automatically when appropriate:

```
run_slash_command({ command: "context" })
→ "Context Usage: 45,000 / 200,000 tokens (22.5%)"

run_slash_command({ command: "compact" })
→ "Session compaction triggered."
```

## Design

This is **Phase 1** of the slash command invocation feature. The approach
is pragmatic: commands whose logic is available via `ExtensionContext` are
executed directly (system prompt access, context usage, compaction).

Commands requiring `ExtensionCommandContext` (session management like
`/clear`, `/new`, `/fork`) cannot be invoked by the model yet — the
framework doesn't expose command handler access to tools. Phase 2 will
add an `allowModelInvocation` flag to command registration and a
framework-level bridge.

## Context injection

The extension injects a hidden message before each agent turn listing
the commands the model can invoke via the tool. This ensures the model
knows the capability exists without polluting visible conversation.

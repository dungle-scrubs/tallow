description: Prompt-based WezTerm pane management — split, close, focus, zoom, resize, send/read text.
---

Control WezTerm panes from natural language. Say "split a new
tallow session to the right" or "close this panel when you're
done" and the LLM translates to `wezterm cli` calls.

Registers a single compound `wezterm_pane` tool with an `action`
discriminator. Only active when `WEZTERM_PANE` is set — in any
other terminal, the extension is a silent no-op.

## Actions

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `list` | List panes in the current tab with IDs, titles, sizes |
| `split` | Split current pane (left/right/top/bottom), optionally run a command |
| `close` | Kill a pane by ID (defaults to current pane) |
| `focus` | Activate a pane by ID or direction |
| `zoom` | Toggle/set zoom state |
| `resize` | Adjust pane size directionally |
| `send_text` | Paste text into a target pane |
| `read_text` | Get visible text from a pane |
| `spawn_tab` | Open a new tab with optional command |
| `move_to_tab` | Detach a pane into its own tab |

## Conditional registration

The extension checks `process.env.WEZTERM_PANE` at load time.
If the variable is absent, no tool is registered and no system
prompt context is injected. Zero overhead outside WezTerm.

## System prompt context

When active, a small context block (~50 tokens) is appended via
`before_agent_start`:

```
# WezTerm Pane Control

You are running in WezTerm pane 42. Use the wezterm_pane tool
to manage panes: split, close, focus, zoom, resize, send/read
text, or spawn new tabs. Use action "list" to see all panes in
the current tab.
```

## Spawning new sessions

Splitting with a command spawns it in the new pane:

```
"split a new tallow session to the right"
→ wezterm cli split-pane --right -- tallow

"open a bottom panel at 30% with haiku"
→ wezterm cli split-pane --bottom --percent 30 -- tallow --model claude-haiku-4-20250414
```

## Self-close behavior

Closing the current pane terminates the tallow process. This is
intentional for requests like "when you're done, close this
panel". The tool logs a warning before executing:
`Closing current pane (pane $ID). This will terminate this session.`

## Relationships with other extensions

### [subagent-tool](/extensions/subagent-tool/)

Subagents run in the same pane as isolated contexts. Use
`wezterm_pane` with `split` + `command: ["tallow"]` to spawn a
visually separate tallow instance in an adjacent pane instead.

### [background-task-tool](/extensions/background-task-tool/)

Background tasks run shell commands in the same process.
`send_text` can paste commands into other panes for work that
should run in a separate terminal context.

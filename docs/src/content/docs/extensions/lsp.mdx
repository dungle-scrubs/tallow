description: Code intelligence via Language Server Protocol.

Full LSP integration giving the agent precise code intelligence:
go-to-definition, find all references, hover for type information,
document symbols, and workspace-wide symbol search. Supports
TypeScript, Python (ty/pyright), Rust, and Swift.

After edits, diagnostics are automatically reported so the agent
can catch type errors and lint issues without you asking.

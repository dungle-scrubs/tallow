description: Code intelligence via Language Server Protocol.

Full LSP integration giving the agent precise code intelligence:
go-to-definition, find all references, hover for type information,
document symbols, and workspace-wide symbol search. Supports
TypeScript, Python (ty/pyright), Rust, and Swift.

After edits, diagnostics are automatically reported so the agent
can catch type errors and lint issues without you asking.

Startup and request operations are time-bounded with automatic cleanup,
so stalled language servers fail fast instead of hanging a tool call.

## Configuration

### `lsp.startupTimeoutMs`

Controls how long tallow waits for a language server to start (process spawn,
server readiness, and initial LSP handshake) before timing out and cleaning up.

Default: `10000` ms.

```json
// .tallow/settings.json
{
  "lsp": {
    "startupTimeoutMs": 15000
  }
}
```

Effective precedence:

1. `.tallow/settings.json` (project)
2. `~/.tallow/settings.json` (user)
3. built-in default (`10000`)

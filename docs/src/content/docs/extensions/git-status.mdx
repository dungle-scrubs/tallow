description: Git branch, dirty state, and PR status in the status bar.
---

Shows git information in the status bar: current branch name,
dirty indicator (`*` for uncommitted changes), ahead/behind counts
relative to the remote, and PR status if GitHub CLI is available.

Updates automatically as the agent makes changes, you always know
which branch you're on and whether there are uncommitted
modifications.

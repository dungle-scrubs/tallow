description: Auto-generates meaningful session names using Haiku after the first response.
---

Automatically names sessions after the first agent response using a
lightweight model (Haiku). Names appear in the footer, terminal tab
title, session selector, and `tallow --list`.

## How it works

After your first message gets a response, the extension fires a
non-blocking Haiku call with the opening exchange. Haiku returns
a 3–8 word descriptive name like "Refactoring auth middleware to
JWT". The name is persisted via `setSessionName()` and picked up
by the [custom-footer](/extensions/custom-footer/) on its next
render cycle — appearing as a dim, right-aligned third row.

Resumed sessions show their name immediately. The Haiku call only
runs once per session and only for unnamed sessions.

## Manual naming

The `/name` command is built into pi. Use it to view or override:

```
/name                    # Show current name
/name Fix auth tests     # Set/override the name
```

## Opt out

```bash
tallow --no-session-name
```

## Model selection

Prefers `claude-haiku-4-5` (fast, cheap). Falls back to
`claude-sonnet-4-5`, then the first available model. If no model
or API key is available, the extension silently does nothing.

## Relationships with other extensions

### [custom-footer](/extensions/custom-footer/)

The footer reads `sessionManager.getSessionName()` each render
and displays the name as a right-aligned third row. The
session-namer extension only writes the name — display is
entirely handled by custom-footer.

### [session-memory](/extensions/session-memory/)

Named sessions are easier to find when using session recall.
The name appears in session listings and helps identify sessions
without reading truncated first messages.

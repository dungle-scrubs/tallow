description: How tallow's extension system works and what ships built-in.
---

tallow ships with 31 built-in extensions that handle everything
from tool output rendering to multi-agent coordination. Extensions
aren't plugins bolted on — they're the primary way tallow's
features are implemented.

## What extensions can do

Extensions have full access to tallow's runtime:

- **Register tools** — give the LLM new capabilities
- **Render TUI widgets** — status bars, task boards, progress indicators
- **Hook lifecycle events** — intercept tool calls, turn completions, errors
- **Register commands** — add `/slash` commands for users
- **Inject context** — modify the system prompt dynamically
- **Compose with each other** — one extension can enhance another

## Categories

Every extension has a `category` property in its `extension.json`
manifest. The docs sidebar and the installer group extensions by
these categories:

> **Note:** Some extensions provide both LLM-callable tools and UI features.
> For example, the `tasks` extension provides a task board UI *and* a `manage_tasks`
> tool that lets the AI manage tasks programmatically.

| Category | Count | What's in it |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Tools** | 15 | bash, edit, read, write, cd, web-fetch, subagent, teams, tasks, plan-mode, agent-commands, ask-user-question, background-task, output-styles, theme-selector, MCP adapter |
| **UI & Display** | 4 | custom footer, git status, tool display, minimal skill display |
| **Utilities** | 5 | cheatsheet, context-usage, init, show-system-prompt, read-tool-enhanced |
| **Commands** | 2 | command-prompt, command-expansion |
| **Integrations** | 1 | lifecycle hooks |
| **Language Support** | 1 | LSP |
| **Context** | 1 | context-files |
| **Aliases** | 1 | /clear → /new |

## How extensions are loaded

All bundled extensions ship with tallow and are loaded
automatically — no separate installation step. Just run `tallow`.

Extensions load from multiple sources in this order:

1. **Bundled** — shipped in the tallow package's `extensions/`
   directory
2. **User global** — `~/.tallow/extensions/`
3. **Project local** — `.tallow/extensions/`

If a user extension has the same directory name as a bundled
extension, the user version overrides the bundled one. tallow
prints a notice at startup when this happens.

## Disabling extensions

The installer lets you disable extension groups. Under the hood,
disabled extension names are stored in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "disabledExtensions": ["git-status", "cheatsheet"]
}
```

You can also pass `--no-extensions` on the CLI to disable all
extensions for a session.

## Creating your own

See [Creating Extensions](/development/creating-extensions/) for
the full guide on building custom extensions.

description: Random cli-spinners preset on each session start.
---

Replaces the default loader spinner (dots) with a randomly-picked
preset from 56 curated [cli-spinners](https://github.com/sindresorhus/cli-spinners)
on each session start. All presets are inlined — no external
dependency at runtime.

## Configuration

Pin a specific spinner in `~/.tallow/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "spinner": "arc"
}
```

Omit the key (or set `"random"`) to get a different spinner each
session. Disable the extension entirely to always use the default
dots.

## Available presets

56 presets selected for reliable rendering in common monospace
terminal fonts. Only frames using well-supported Unicode blocks
(ASCII, Braille, Box Drawing, Block Elements, Geometric Shapes,
etc.) are included.

Some examples: `dots`, `arc`, `arrow`, `bouncingBar`, `clock`,
`earth`, `moon`, `runner`, `star`, `toggle`.

## How it works

At `session_start`, the extension reads the `spinner` setting. If
absent or `"random"`, it picks a random preset from the built-in
map. The chosen frames and interval are applied to the global
`Loader` instance via `Loader.setDefaultSpinner()`.

The [\_icons](/extensions/overview/) extension sets a baseline
spinner via `getSpinner()`. This extension overrides that baseline
— it loads after `_icons` in the extension order.

## Relationships with other extensions

### [\_icons](/extensions/overview/)

The icon registry provides `getSpinner()` which returns the
user-configured spinner frames. `random-spinner` overrides the
Loader's spinner directly, taking precedence over the icon
registry's default.

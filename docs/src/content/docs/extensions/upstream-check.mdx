title: upstream-check
description: Dev-only version check for upstream pi dependencies.
---

Compares pinned versions of `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` and
`@mariozechner/pi-tui` against the npm registry. Only registers
when `packages/tallow-tui/` exists — i.e. inside the tallow dev
checkout. Does nothing when tallow is installed as a package.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/upstream` | Check for new upstream versions |

## How it works

The extension reads the current pinned versions from
`package.json` (both `dependencies` and `devDependencies`), then
fetches the latest published versions from the npm registry with
a 4-second timeout. If a newer version is available, it displays
a notification with the current and latest versions.

Multiple outdated packages are combined into a single
notification rather than showing one per package.

## When it loads

The extension checks for `packages/tallow-tui/` at startup. If
that directory doesn't exist, it skips registration entirely —
no commands, no network calls. This ensures it only activates
in the tallow development environment.

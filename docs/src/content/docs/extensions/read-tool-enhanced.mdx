description: Smart file reading with compact summaries and SKILL.md rendering.

File reads show the first 7 lines while loading, then collapse to
a compact summary, filename, line count, and size. The full
content is always sent to the LLM's context regardless of what's
displayed.

SKILL.md files get special rendering with a distinct visual
treatment. Press `ctrl+o` to expand any read to its full content.

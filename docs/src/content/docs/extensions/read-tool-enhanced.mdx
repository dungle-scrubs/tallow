description: Smart file reading with compact summaries, SKILL.md rendering, and PDF extraction.
---

File reads show the first 7 lines while loading, then collapse to
a compact summary with filename, line count, and size. The full
content is always sent to the LLM's context regardless of what's
displayed.

SKILL.md files get special rendering with a distinct visual
treatment. Press `ctrl+o` to expand any read to its full content.

## PDF support

The `read` tool now parses PDF files and extracts text instead of
returning binary garbage.

### Read full PDF

```text
read path/to/spec.pdf
```

Returns extracted text plus a summary (`<path> (<N> pages, <size>KB extracted)`).

### Read specific pages

```text
read path/to/spec.pdf pages="1-5"
read path/to/spec.pdf pages="1,3,7-10"
```

`pages` is ignored for non-PDF files.

### Error handling

- Encrypted/password-protected PDFs return a clear error
- Corrupt PDFs return parse errors
- Image-only PDFs report that no extractable text was found

## Interaction with @file references

`file-reference` now understands PDFs too:

- Small PDFs are inlined directly into prompt context
- Large PDFs are summarized with metadata + first-page preview
- The summary suggests `read <file> pages="..."` for targeted extraction

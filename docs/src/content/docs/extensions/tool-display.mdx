description: Configure visible output lines per tool during and after execution.
---

Shared configuration that controls how many lines each tool shows
during execution and after completion. Truncation position (head
or tail) determines whether the first or last N lines are visible.
Tools can opt out of truncation entirely.

This is a library extension, other tool extensions (bash-live,
read-summary, etc.) import its configuration to ensure consistent
display behavior across all tools.

## Clickable file paths

File tool headers (read, edit, write) emit
[OSC 8 hyperlinks](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda),
making file paths clickable in supported terminals (iTerm2,
WezTerm, Kitty, Windows Terminal, GNOME Terminal 3.26+, etc.).
Clicking a path opens the file in the system default handler.
Terminals that don't support OSC 8 display the path as plain
text — no visual difference.

description: Configure visible output lines per tool during and after execution.
---

Shared configuration that controls how many lines each tool shows
during execution and after completion. Truncation position (head
or tail) determines whether the first or last N lines are visible.
Tools can opt out of truncation entirely.

This is a library extension, other tool extensions (bash-live,
read-summary, etc.) import its configuration to ensure consistent
display behavior across all tools.

## Presentation roles

Tool-display also exports shared presentation helpers used by
`tasks`, `subagent-tool`, and `teams-tool` dashboards:

- **title** — section headers and primary headings
- **action** — what an agent/tool is actively doing now
- **identity** — deterministic identity styling (`@name`)
- **meta** — counters, tree lines, timestamps, structural context
- **process_output** — low-priority output chatter/log tails
- **status** — success/warning/error state indicators
- **hint** — guidance and secondary helper text

Use `formatPresentationText(theme, role, text)` for role-based text
hierarchy and `formatIdentityText(text, seed)` for deterministic
identity colors across extensions.

## Clickable file paths

File tool headers (read, edit, write) emit
[OSC 8 hyperlinks](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda),
making file paths clickable in supported terminals (iTerm2,
WezTerm, Kitty, Windows Terminal, GNOME Terminal 3.26+, etc.).
Clicking a path opens the file in the system default handler.
Terminals that don't support OSC 8 display the path as plain
text — no visual difference.

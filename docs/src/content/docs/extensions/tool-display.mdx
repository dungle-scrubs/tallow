description: Configure visible output lines per tool during and after execution.
---

Shared configuration that controls how many lines each tool shows
during execution and after completion. Truncation position (head
or tail) determines whether the first or last N lines are visible.
Tools can opt out of truncation entirely.

This is a library extension, other tool extensions (bash-live,
read-summary, etc.) import its configuration to ensure consistent
display behavior across all tools.

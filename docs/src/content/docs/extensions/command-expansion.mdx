description: Expand nested commands and skills used as arguments to other commands.
---

When a command or skill is used as an argument to another command,
this extension expands it to its content before passing it through.
`/outer-command /skill:inner-skill args` expands the inner skill
first, then feeds the result to the outer command.

Supports recursive expansion (nested within nested) and works with
skills, prompt templates, and other registered commands.

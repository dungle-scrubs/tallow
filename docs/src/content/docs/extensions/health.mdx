Run `/health` (or `/doctor`) to print a diagnostic overview of
the current session. The output renders inline as a tree-style
layout covering seven sections:

| Section | What it shows |
|---------|---------------|
| **Session** | ID, file, name, CWD, branch/entry counts |
| **Model** | Provider, ID, context window, max output, reasoning, thinking level, input modalities |
| **Context** | Token usage with percentage, OK / Warning / Critical status |
| **Tools** | Active vs total count, active tool names |
| **Commands** | Registered count with per-source breakdown |
| **Extensions** | Active theme name |
| **Environment** | Tallow version, framework version, Node version, platform, home and package directories |

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/health` | Show session diagnostics |
| `/doctor` | Alias for `/health` |

## Responsive layout

The output adapts to terminal width:

- **< 80 columns** — single column, sections stacked vertically
- **80–159 columns** — two columns side-by-side
- **≥ 160 columns** — three columns

Long values (e.g. tool lists) are truncated with `…` to prevent
overflow.

## Context status

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| OK | ≤ 50% context used |
| Warning | 51–80% |
| Critical | > 80% |

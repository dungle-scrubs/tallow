title: custom-footer
description: Responsive status bar with git, tokens, cost, and model info.
---

A dense, information-rich status bar at the bottom of the TUI
showing everything you need at a glance: current working directory,
git branch with dirty state, token usage (input/output), context
window utilization, session cost, active subagent count, model
name, and thinking level.

## Responsive layout

The footer adapts to terminal width:

**Wide terminals (2–3 lines):**
```
~/dev/project                                              main*
↑1.2k ↓39k R12M W708k $11.444 (sub) 68.4%/200k (auto) model • high
                                         ─ Refactoring auth to JWT
```

**Narrow terminals (4–5 lines):**
```
~/dev/project
 main*
↑1.2k ↓39k R12M W708k $11.444 (sub) 68.4%/200k (auto)
model • high
                                         ─ Refactoring auth to JWT
```

The third row (session name) only appears when a name has been set
by the [session-namer](/extensions/session-namer/) extension. It's
right-aligned and dimmed so it stays unobtrusive.

The wide layout puts the working directory and git branch on the
first line (directory left, branch right), then metrics and model
on the second. The narrow layout stacks everything vertically.
All values truncate gracefully, long paths are shortened, metrics
compress, so nothing overflows.

## Relationships with other extensions

### [tasks](/extensions/tasks/) + [subagent](/extensions/subagent-tool/)

When subagents are running, the tasks extension adds a colored
agent bar to the status area, `@main @alice @bob · 2 teammates`
positioned above the footer. The footer itself shows `(sub)`
with the active subagent count. Together they give two levels of
detail: the footer for a number, the agent bar for names.

### [git-status](/extensions/git-status/)

The footer handles git display directly, branch name, dirty
indicator (`*`), ahead/behind counts. The git-status extension
provides the same information. If both are active, the footer's
own git rendering takes precedence. Git state is cached with a
5-second TTL to avoid running `git` on every render frame.

### Stacking with the tasks widget

When the tasks widget, agent bar, and footer are all active,
they stack vertically at the bottom of the terminal:

```
Tasks (2/5)                          │  2 agents launched
├─ ◐ Writing tests (@alice)          │  └─ ⠋ @alice · 12s
└─ ☐ Update docs                     │
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
@main @alice · 1 teammate
~/dev/project                                        main*
↑3.2k ↓89k R12M W1.4M $4.221 (1 sub) 42%/200k  sonnet • high
```

The widget occupies the most vertical space, the agent bar one
line, and the footer two or four lines depending on width. All
three adapt independently to the available width.

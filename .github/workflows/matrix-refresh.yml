            ```
            ${{ steps.refresh.outputs.report }}
            ```

            ## Review Guide
            - Check that rating changes match Arena trends
            - Verify no models were incorrectly mapped
            - Look for unmapped models that should be added
            - Run `bun scripts/refresh-model-matrix.ts` locally to verify
